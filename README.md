===============================

Oh, the pulley menus! They are so good that you are able to use them without looking at the screen.  
And that's really a problem with the morning alarm :)

This simple patch adds to the Alarm user interface a simple Maths question,
that you need to resolve to make the alarm dismiss for good.

Timers and Calendar reminders are not affected by this patch.

**Note**: you won't find divisions, I don't hate myself *too* much to make
my alarm ask me for a division at 5:30 AM :P
